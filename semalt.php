Plugin Name:  Semalt Redirect Manager
Plugin URI:   http://peadig.com/wordpress-plugins/semalt/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Admin&utm_campaign=Semalt
Description:  We all know how annoying it is when we see Semalt mess up our analytics data. This plugin helps you stop that from happening by referring Semalt's crawler elsewhere! Based on an idea by Rishi Lakhani.
